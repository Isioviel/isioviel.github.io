            <p>Without a clean soldering iron, you will always struggle to make a good joint.</p>
            <p>The tip of your iron, when hot, should be bright silver. If it is dull and brown, follow these steps to <em>clean</em> and <em>tin</em> it.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Heat up your iron.</li>
              <li>Clean any deposits off the tip using brass wool or a wet sponge.</li>
              <li>Melt some solder onto the tip, then it clean off using your brass wool or sponge.</li>
              <li>The flux in the centre of your solder should <em>clean</em> the tip, and the solder itself should <em>tin</em> it.</li>
              <li>Repeat this process a couple of times if necessary, to get a bright tip.</li>
              <li>If this is not working, you can buy <em>tip tinner or cleaner</em>.
                This is a mixture of flux and solder, especially designed for this purpose.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>When you are finished, your iron's tip should be bright silver.</p>
            <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\soldering\cleaning-iron.jpg" alt="clean soldering tip">
            <p>When you have finished soldering, repeat steps 2 and 3 before turning off your iron.
              This will keep the iron clean, making it easier to use in the future.</p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead bg-orange">Deciphering a soldering kit</h2>
            <p>The workshop uses a LED soldering kit bought from
              <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32842624201.html" target="_blank">Aliexpress</a>.</p>
            <p>If you are not sure how to place all of your components correctly onto your board,
              this section will help you to identify all of the parts -
              both for this board and for future projects.</p>
            <a href="#necessary">To skip straight to the final instructions, click here.</a>
            <p>The first step is matching all of your components to their space on the board.
              Lay out all of the components in front of you.</p>
            <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\soldering\components-all.jpg" alt="board and all components">
            <p>Even if you don't know what the components are,
              you can get a a good idea where most of the parts go
              by looking at the shape and size of them, as well as the number of parts.</p>
            <p>For example:</p>

            <h3>Light emitting diodes (LEDs)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>There is a circle of ten component spaces around the edge of the board,
                all labelled <strong>L</strong> plus a number.</li>
              <li>You have at least ten LEDs in your kit (the red bulbs).
                Logically, these components should match, as there is nothing else suitable in your kit.</li>
              <li>LEDs have <strong>polarity</strong> - they will only work in one direction.</li>
              <li>Look carefully at one of the LEDs, the top is not a complete circle -
                one edge is flat. This edge matches up with the flat side of the drawings on the board.</li>
              <li>On other boards, LEDs could be labelled with a <strong>D</strong> for <em>diode</em>,
                or the electrical symbol for an LED.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Button switch</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>You have a button switch, with four leads - there is only one place on the board this can go.</li>
              <li>Its orientation does not matter - it cannot fit in the board in an incorrect way.</li>
              <li>Its space is labelled <strong>S</strong> for switch.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Chips</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>You have two chips - a large one and a small one. They can both only fit on one location.</li>
              <li>These <strong>must</strong> be placed in the correct orientation.</li>
              <li>Look carefully at one of the chips - you should see a small dimple on the top.</li>
              <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\soldering\components-chip.jpg" alt="close-up of chip">
              <li>Match this dimple with the drawing on the board.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Capacitors</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>You have three capacitors in your kit - two large blue ones, and one small orange one.
              There are three spaces labelled <strong>C</strong> on your board, but they all look slightly different.</li>
              <li>The small orange capacitor has the number <strong>103</strong> printed on it -
                find its space on the board. This capacitor is not <strong>polarised</strong>.</li>
              <li>There are two more spaces for capacitors on the board,
                one of them has a label <strong>47uF</strong> -
                look carefully at your two capacitors to find the one labelled 47uF.</li>
              <li>These two capacitors <strong>are</strong> polarised.
                 They have a stripe down one side to show the negative lead.</li>
              <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\soldering\components-cap-polarity.jpg" alt="close-up of capacitor">
              <li>This stripe matches the shaded side of the drawing on the board.</li>
              <li>Other boards may use the electrical symbol for a capacitor instead of a shaded drawing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Transistor</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>You have one component that has three legs. There is only one place for it to go!</li>
              <li>It matters which way around this component is placed -
                match its shape to the drawing on the board.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Resistors</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>You have four resistors, and four spaces on the board labelled <strong>R</strong>.</li>
              <li>Two of the spaces are also labelled <strong>470K</strong>,
                one labelled <strong>10K</strong> and one <strong>100</strong>.</li>
              <li>Look carefully at your four resistors - paying attention to the coloured bands.
              Two of them are identical, so must match with the two spaces labelled <strong>470K</strong>.</li>
              <li>To work out the difference between your final two resistors,
                you need to use a resistor colour chart.

                  Click here for one example</a>.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Battery pack</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Find the holes on your board labelled <strong>+ -</strong> and <strong>DC 5V</strong>.</li>
                <li>The black wire on your battery pack goes to the negative hole,
                  the red wire to the positive hole.</li>
                <li>You have four holes on the board, two larger than the other.</li>
                <li>The two smaller holes are for soldering your wires to.
                  The two larger holes are for pushing the wires through first,
                  to help with stress relief so that the connection does not get pulled apart.</li>
                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\soldering\board-batteries.jpg" alt="close-up of capacitor">
              </ul>

            <h3 id="necessary">Key points</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>If there is a drawing on the board indicating a shape - match it to your component,
                it will almost certainly not work in any other orientation.</li>
              <li>If there is no indication of which way around to place a component,
                it probably does not matter which way around it goes.</li>
              <li>If there is a number on the board, you will almost certainly have a component to match it.</li>
              <li>If you work out most of the components this way, you have less to google!</li>
            </ul>

          <div id="instructions">
            <h2 class="content-subhead bg-yellow">Soldering the PCB</h2>
            <p>A good habit to get into is starting from the shortest component,
              in this case the resistors. If you start with a tall component,
              you will be balancing the board awkwardly for the rest of the time!</p>
            <h3>Quirks of this board...</h3>
            <p>On this board, the drawing to show the polarity of <strong>L6</strong>
              is covered by other things.</p>
            <p>To work out which way around it should go, turn the board over to look at the
              <strong>copper traces</strong> - these are the paler green lines.</p>
            <p><strong>If two holes are in the same patch of pale green, they are connected together.</strong></p>
            <p>The flat side of the LED is the negative side, and all of the negative sides
              will connect to <strong>ground</strong>,
              which means they all connect to the same place, therefore each other.</p>
            <p>Look for the hole that the negative side of <strong>L5</strong> or <strong>L7</strong>
              will be soldered to, and see which pale green trace it is in.
              The <strong>L6</strong> hole in the same trace, will be negative side of the LED.</p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">Next steps</h2>
            <p>Cheap soldering kits are easy to get hold of from e.g. Aliexpress or eBay.</p>
            <p>Higher quality kits can be more useful once you've had some practice -
              you can make badges to wear, or something functional such as a battery tester.</p>
            <p><a href="https://boldport.com/" target="_blank">Boldport</a> kits are both beautiful and (sometimes) functional,
              and come with great documentation!</p>
