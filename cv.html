            <h3>GLAM Digital Makers</h3>
            <p>I am currently working on the GLAM Labs project with the <strong>University of Oxford’s Gardens,
              Libraries and Museums (GLAM)</strong> to help their staff gain the skills and confidence needed to run
              digital workshops. This involves running training workshops for staff members and working with them
              to develop their project ideas around their own working environments and collections.</p>
            <p><em>This is currently in progress, but some of the resources can be seen here: <a href="https://isioviel.github.io/GLAM" target="_blank">GLAM Project Resources</a></em></p>

            <h3>Future Engineers Project & Robocamp</h3>
            <p>I developed and delivered a <strong>Robot Camp</strong> for Science Oxford,
              funded by the IET/IMechE, in 2018, working with young people in the Rose Hill Community Centre
              to build and program a <strong>BBC micro:bit</strong> robot in <strong>MicroPython</strong>
              or <strong>Edublocks</strong> over the course a week. I taught them <strong>basic programming skills</strong>,
              how to <strong>solder</strong> and how to <strong>design 2d and 3d models in TinkerCAD</strong>.
              They then built robots around their <strong>laser cut</strong> robot chassis designs,
              and programming their choice of sensors.</p>
            <p><em>I gave a talk about the project at PyCon UK, which can be viewed here: <a href="https://pyvideo.org/pycon-uk-2018/future-engineers.html" target="_blank">Future Engineers PyCon talk</a></em></p>
            <p>Evaluation was very positive, so I am ran a variant of the camp, <strong>Robocamp</strong>,
              in August 2019 at the Science Oxford Centre in Headington.
              Learning from previous experience, I <strong>designed a printed circuit board (PCB) in KiCAD</strong>
              for the young people to solder, and preparing a range of <strong>differentiated instruction sheets</strong>
              to give more help to those who need it, whilst still providing challenges.
              To give more room for creativity, I am prepared a greater range of challenges for them to complete
              at the end of the week, such as an obstacle course, a dance-off and robot football.</p>

            <h3>Creative Computing Club</h3>
            <p>I run a successful computing club for Science Oxford, one Saturday a month.
              I choose a new theme for each month, for example programming Minecraft with
              <strong>Python on a Raspberry Pi</strong>, programming <strong>BBC micro:bit</strong> self-driving cars,
              designing games for <strong>Scratch</strong> Day, programming ‘Choose-Your-Own-Adventure’ books for World Book Day,
              and coding puzzle boxes to answer riddles.</p>
            <p>Each month I have a mixture of returning students and new attendees,
              so have gained a lot of experience of managing groups of <strong>mixed ability and experience levels</strong>.
            <p>I was interviewed about my club on the Ubuntu Podcast, which you can listen to here: <a href="https://ubuntupodcast.org/2019/09/05/s12e22-shadow-of-the-beast/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Podcast S12E22</a></em></p>

            <h3>Adult Coding Course</h3>
            <p>Last year I developed and ran a six-week <strong>beginner Python programming</strong> course for adults.
              I started with basic <strong>programming on a micro:bit</strong>, then moved on to sensors,
              data collection via a <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> and data analysis. For the final two weeks,
              I supported them as they worked on a project of their choice including a micro:bit morse code decoder,
              a graphical user interface (GUI) and a micro:bit seismograph outreach project.
              At the end of the course, I organised a <strong>Raspberry Jam meetup</strong>,
              to introduce them to other local digital makers, and encouraged the attendees to share their projects with them.</p>
            <p><em>Files from the course can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/ScienceOxford/intro-to-programming" target="_blank">Introduction to Programming</a></em></p>

            <h3>Antweight Robots</h3>
            <p>I compete in ‘antweight’ robot competitions, mini robot wars with weight (150g) and size (4” cube) restrictions.
              I enter two styles of robot. The first being fully <strong>3d printed</strong>, designed in <strong>Fusion 360</strong>,
              with well researched electronics, the second <strong>micro:bit</strong> controlled and built from
              <strong>accessible materials</strong> and scrap. My aim in entering these competitions is to learn new skills,
              share design ideas with other builders, and build entertaining robots that start conversations.</p>
            <p><em>Find out more about my antweights here: <a href="robots-antweight.html" target="_blank">Antweights</a></em></p>

            <h3>Pi Wars</h3>
            <p>I led a team, Sky Fawkes, in this year’s Pi Wars – a robotics competition based around the <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>,
              with a number of remote control and autonomous challenges. I created the physical robot,
              designed in <strong>Fusion 360</strong> and <strong>Inkscape</strong>, with both 3d printed and laser cut parts,
              <strong>working with my team</strong> to design around the features we needed to succeed in the challenges.
              I also programmed the distance sensors used in some of the challenges, learning to <strong>adapt previously written code</strong>
              to suit our needs, and worked with young people at Science Oxford to program firework animations
              to run on an attached micro:bit.</p>
            <p><em>Blog posts about the design and build of Sky Fawkes can be found here: <a href="https://skyfawkes.home.blog/" target="_blank">Sky Fawkes blog</a></em></p>
